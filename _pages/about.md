## About me

---

I am a PhD student in the Institute of Applied Information Processing and Communications
([IAIK](https://www.iaik.tugraz.at) by its German initials) at the Graz University of Technology. 
<br>
I use formal methods to develop trust in
AI.
I am particularly interested in accountability of AI systems and also in runtime verification and enforcement of safety-critical properties.
<br>
I received my MSc degree in Advanced Mathematics and Mathematical Engineering from [BarcelonaTech](https://www.upc.edu) in 2019.
