I am a PhD student in the Systematic Construction of Correct Systems group at the Graz University of Technology.
I received my MSc degree in Mathematics and Mathematical Engineering from BarcelonaTech in 2019.
My research is focused on generating trustworthy artificial intelligence through the use of formal methods.
I am particularly interested in accountability of AI systems and also in runtime verification and enforcement of safety-critical properties.
