<strong> Abstract: </strong>
This report documents the program and the outcomes of the Dagstuhl Seminar "Safety Assurance for Autonomous Mobility" (24071). The seminar brought together an interdisciplinary group of researchers and practitioners from the fields of formal methods, cyber-physical systems, and artificial intelligence, with a common interest in autonomous mobility. Through a series of talks, working groups, and open problem discussions, participants explored the challenges and opportunities associated with ensuring the safety of autonomous systems in various domains, including industrial automation, automotive, railways, and aerospace. Key topics addressed included the need for industrial-grade autonomous products to operate reliably in safety-critical environments, highlighting the lack of standardized procedures for obtaining safety certifications for AI-based systems. Recent advancements in the verification and validation (V&V) of autonomous mobility systems were presented, focusing on requirements verification, testing, certification, and correct-by-design approaches. Overall, the seminar provided a comprehensive overview of the current state and future directions in safe autonomous mobility, emphasizing the need for interdisciplinary collaboration and innovation to address the complex challenges in this rapidly evolving field.

<strong> Abstract: </strong>
This report documents the program and the outcomes of Dagstuhl Seminar 23411 "Accountable Software Systems". The seminar brought together an interdisciplinary group of researchers from the fields of formal methods, machine learning, philosophy, political science, law, and policy studies to address the critical issue of accountability in the development and deployment of software systems. As these systems increasingly assume roles within safety-critical domains of society, including transportation, healthcare, recruitment, and the judiciary, the seminar aimed to explore the multifaceted concept of accountability, its significance, and its implementation challenges in this context. During the seminar, experts engaged deeply in discussions, presentations, and collaborative sessions, focusing on key themes such as the application of formal tools in socio-technical accountability, the impact of computing infrastructures on software accountability, and the innovation of formal languages and models to improve accountability measures. This interdisciplinary dialogue underscored the complexities involved in defining and operationalizing accountability, especially in light of technological advancements and their societal implications. The participants of the seminar reached a consensus on the pressing need for ongoing research and cross-disciplinary efforts to develop effective accountability mechanisms, highlighting the critical role of integrating socio-technical approaches and formal methodologies to enhance the accountability of autonomous systems and their contributions to society.
